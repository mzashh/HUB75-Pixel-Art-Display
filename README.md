# HUB75-Pixel-Art-Display
A LED Pixel Art Display based on HUB75 panels driven by the ESP32

# Features
As of now the firmware has minimum fuctionality, it plays a GIF files stored in the SPI Flash of the ESP32.

I have also implemented a WEB-UI using a async web server which allows to upload, delete, download and delete GIFS on the ESP32.

The WEB-UI also has auth functionality and allows for remote rebooting of the ESP32.
